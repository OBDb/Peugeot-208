    description: "The first-generation Peugeot 208 represented a significant redesign compared to its predecessor, the 207, with a focus on reduced weight, improved efficiency, and a more premium feel. Available in three and five-door hatchback body styles, it featured distinctive styling with a 'floating' front grille, cat's-eye headlights, and 'claw' taillights that would become signature Peugeot design elements. Powertrains included a range of efficient PureTech gasoline engines (1.0L to 1.6L) and BlueHDi diesel options (1.4L to 1.6L), with the performance-oriented GTi variant featuring a 1.6L turbocharged engine producing up to 208 horsepower in the GTi by Peugeot Sport special edition. The interior introduced Peugeot's new i-Cockpit design philosophy with a small steering wheel positioned below the instrument cluster, a high-mounted dashboard, and a touchscreen infotainment system on most variants. Despite being smaller externally than the 207, clever packaging maintained interior space while reducing weight by approximately 110 kg, improving both performance and efficiency. A mid-cycle refresh in 2015 brought subtle styling updates, improved infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and enhanced safety features. The 208 successfully repositioned Peugeot's supermini as a more upscale offering in the segment, winning multiple awards and performing well in European markets where its combination of style, efficiency, and perceived quality helped distinguish it from volume competitors."

    description: "The second-generation Peugeot 208 features a bold evolution of Peugeot's design language with a more aggressive front end, distinctive LED lighting including 'fang' daytime running lights, and a black rear panel with LED 'claw' taillights spanning the width of the car. Built on PSA's new CMP (Common Modular Platform), it's offered exclusively as a five-door hatchback. A significant innovation is the availability of multiple powertrain options on the same platform: traditional PureTech gasoline engines (75-130 hp), BlueHDi diesel options in some markets, and the fully electric e-208 with a 50 kWh battery providing approximately 217 miles (350 km) of range. The interior represents a major advancement of the i-Cockpit concept with 3D holographic-effect digital instruments, a larger central touchscreen with piano-key shortcut buttons, and higher quality materials throughout. Available technology includes semi-autonomous driving features, adaptive cruise control, automatic parking, and a suite of connected services. Performance models moved away from the GTi badge tradition, with the GT and GT-Line trims offering sportier styling and equipment but less performance focus than previous GTi models. The e-208 electric variant shares most styling elements with combustion models but offers distinctive color accents and dedicated displays. This generation positions the 208 further upmarket with improved refinement, technology, and design sophistication while maintaining competitive pricing, winning European Car of the Year 2020 and establishing Peugeot's position at the premium end of the mainstream supermini segment."
